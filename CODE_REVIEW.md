Code Issues:-

    - There is no proper debounce in the search every time it needs to click search button or press Enter. 
    - There is no spinner to show whats happening in the background.
    - There is no Pagination. If data is more than 10 it just simply loads all on the page.
    - When ever new input is given in Search Bar Data is not getting empty it load Previous Data and reload when new data is present.

Accessibility

    - Text in the Header is very small for desktop users.
    - Search Bar is also very small for Desktop.
    - Logo does't seems like a actual Logo needs more Imporvement.
    - Want to Read button over laps in small devices. Added Media query for a responsive.
    - For Button Search Accessibility is fixed and its 97%.

Note:-
    - For search debounce for 500ms is added in books api.
    - Spinner is added for search field.
